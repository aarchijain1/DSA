// COMPONENTS OF STL:
// We have three components in STL:
// Containers-stores data and use template classes
// Algorithm-Algorithms are a set of instructions which use template function also which manipulates the input data to arrive at some desired result. 
// Iterators-it is an object which pints to an element in a container and is handled just like pointers which connects algo with container
