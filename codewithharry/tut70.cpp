    /* containers-
    1)sequence containers- data is stored in linear fashion (vector, list , dequeue)  _ - _ - _ - _
    2)associative containers-direct access -(( map, multimap, set ,multi-set)     - stores data structure in tree type 
    3)derived containers- these containers are derived - real world modelling -(queue , stack ,priority queue)


    WHEN TO USE WHICH?

**In sequence containers, 

1)Vectors:
Faster random access to elements in comparison to array
Slower insertion and deletion at some random position, except at the end.
Faster insertion at the end.
 

2) Lists:
Random accessing elements is too slow, because every element is traversed using pointers.
Insertion and deletion at any position is relatively faster, because they only use pointers, which can easily be manipulated.
